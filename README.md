# Computer-Vision
Repository on tasks on computer vision with neural networks. Tasks include Image classification, Captioning, Object detection and Segmentation. For details on deployment of some of these models, you can view the [Model Playground repository](https://github.com/Akorex/Model-Playground)


## Recognising-bird-species-with-CNNs

This is a python code to train a convolutional neural net to identify and classify birds into 400 specie classes on the Bird Species Classification dataset available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species).

The dataset is composed of 315 different bird species. 45980 training images, 1575 test images(5 images per species) and 1575 validation images(5 images per species.
All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color images in jpg format.



## CAPTCHA-with-CNNs

This is a python code to train a convolutional neural net to read CAPTCHA images and output the text in them as a string. It is trained on the dataset at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images).

This dataset contains CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) images. Built in 1997 as way for users to identify and block bots (in order to prevent spam, DDOS etc.).

The images are 5 letter words that can contain numbers. The images have had noise applied to them (blur and a line). They are 200 x 50 PNGs.

## Recognizing-Traffic-Signs-with-CNNs

This is a python code to train a convolutional neural net to identify and classify traffic signs into 43 classes as trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
